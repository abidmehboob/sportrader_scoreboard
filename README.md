# Football World Cup Scoreboard

This is a Java Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing a live scoreboard for football matches in a world cup. The application is built using reactive programming with Spring WebFlux, and stores data in an H2 database using Flyway for migration.

## Requirements

The application provides the following functionalities:

1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard. This should capture following parameters:
    - Home team
    - Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.

## Usage

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
## Frontend
1. Web Portal for ongoing matches, add new match, finish match as well update match score.
